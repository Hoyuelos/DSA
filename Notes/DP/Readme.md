In this approach, we break down bigger problem into smaller subproblems and solve them first and save their results. Then we use these results to solve the bigger problem.

(So, our main problem should be made up of many small subproblems whose solutions can be used to solve it)


Characterstics of DP - 
1. Optimal substructure - optimal solution of the subproblems lead us to optimal solution of our main problem.
2. Overlapping subproblems - subproblems repeat, thus we save their results and reuse it.


We try all the choices, and see which ice is the best.
