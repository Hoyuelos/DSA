Spanning tree - 

(We will be talking about undirected graphs)
A dfs on a graph produces a tree. (No cycle)

A spanning tree is a tree spanning across all the vertices of the graph. (Each vertex is connected)

There can be multiple spanning trees possible in a graph (As from a node, we start off with any of its child)

If edges of the graph has weights, then spanning tree with min weights is called a MST.



Union find is used here for its implementation.
