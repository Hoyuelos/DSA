The greedy choice is to always pick the next activity whose finish time is the least among the remaining activities and the start time is more than or equal to the finish time of the previously selected activity. We can sort the activities according to their finishing time so that we always consider the next activity as the minimum finishing time activity



Follow the given steps to solve the problem:

Sort the activities according to their finishing time 
Select the first activity from the sorted array and print it 
Do the following for the remaining activities in the sorted array
If the start time of this activity is greater than or equal to the finish time of the previously selected activity then select this activity and print it
