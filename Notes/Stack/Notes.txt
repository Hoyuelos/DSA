Stack - 

LIFO - Last in first out

What goes at the last comes out first.


Example - Undo feature in various applications. (Last performed action is at the top of the stack and is popped out first when we want to undo).


A stack should not be always imagined as a vertical container (as it will limit our thinking), 
An array can also function like a stack, when we are iterating from left to right (from start index and towards the end), and want to process data present at our index first.
