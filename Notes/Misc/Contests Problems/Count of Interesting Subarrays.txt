Count of Interesting Subarrays

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums, an integer modulo, and an integer k.

Your task is to find the count of subarrays that are interesting.

A subarray nums[l..r] is interesting if the following condition holds:

Let cnt be the number of indices i in the range [l, r] such that nums[i] % modulo == k. Then, cnt % modulo == k.
Return an integer denoting the count of interesting subarrays.

Note: A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this we need to find number of subarrays, that are interesting. (Satisfying the given condition)

Interesting number - number%mod=k -> number is interesting
Interesting array - count (count of interesting numbers in the array), if - count%mod=k, then the arrays is interesting.



Brute force - 

Check all the subarrays and find the interesting ones. 

Time complexity - O(n^2)


class Solution {
    public long countInterestingSubarrays(List<Integer> list, int mod, int k) {
        int len = list.size();
        int ans=0;
        
        for(int i=0;i<len;i++){
            int cnt=0;
            for(int j=i;j<len;j++){
                if(list.get(j)%mod==k)  cnt++;
                if(cnt%mod==k)  ans++;
            }
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
}

Optimized approach -


We are just concerned with the count of interesting numbers. (And not the numbers themselves)

So let's first find out which numbers are interesting. (Using a flag we can mark them as interesting or not interesting)

Now, we are concerned of the count of these interesting numbers (I.e. we need to find out the subarray satisfying the given condition)

Ex  - 
  arr - [ 3, 1, 9, 6]  mod=3, k=0
 Flag - [ 1, 0, 1, 1]

Prefix sum -
      - [ 1, 1, 2, 3]
   (This will have count of interesting numbers from 0 to ith index)

Since mod=3 and k=0, so we need to have a subarray with count = {0,3,6,9,...}
