a Monotonic Stack ensures that the elements inside the stack remain in an increasing or decreasing order.

hey are particularly effective when it comes to problems requiring us to find the next smaller or larger element in a sequence, often referred to as Next Greater Element (NGE) or Next Smaller Element (NSE) problems.


Monotonic Stacks are typically useful when dealing with problems that involve analyzing sequences or arrays, especially when you need to find the next or previous larger or smaller element for each element in the array.


One classic sign that a Monotonic Stack might be helpful is when the problem description mentions finding the "next greater element" or the "next smaller element" in an array. Problems that involve finding maximum areas, such as in histograms, can also be solved effectively using Monotonic Stacks. Remember, the key is to identify patterns where a sequential step-by-step comparison is necessary.
