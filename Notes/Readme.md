General strategy for DSA problems -

1. Read and understand the given problem thoroughly
2. **Make a note of constraints on the inputs. As, this not only help us decide our approach based on time complexity but also gives insights on certain conditions or some hints to solve the problem effeciently.**
3. Use a notebook if possible to draw out initial approach, keeping in mind the given conditions and constraints.
4. Start with brute force approach and find its time and space complexity.
5. Try to optimise it for reduced time and space complexity.
