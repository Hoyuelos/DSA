This can be used to sort an array (having numbers from range 1 to N) in constant space and in O(n) time.

The idea is - if we have number from 1 to N in an array, in the sorted array each number will be at the index number-1. 
So, we can iterate over the array and put numbers at their correct place (as we know what's their correct place is).

(The basic idea behind cyclic sort is to iterate through the array and place each element in its intended position until the entire array is sorted.)

It can be modified a little if the range is from 0 to N.
