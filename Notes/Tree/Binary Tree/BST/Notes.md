Binary Search Tree

* Every node in the left subtree has a value lesser than the parent node.
* Every node in the right subtree has a value greater than the parent node.
* Inorder traversal of a BST is a sorted list. (sorted in ascending order) - we traverse the tree in its natural sorting order. 
(smallest first and moving towards largest)
* Preorder traversal - first we process the current node and then we traverse its children.
* Postorder traversal - first we traverse left and the right subtree of the current node and then we process it.
